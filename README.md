# Dart IndexOutOfRangeException Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: the `IndexOutOfRangeException`.  The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access an element in a list using an index that's beyond the list's bounds.  The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a solution to handle this exception gracefully and prevent the application from crashing.

This example highlights the importance of input validation and error handling when working with lists and arrays in Dart.
